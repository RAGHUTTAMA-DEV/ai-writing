The air hung thick with the stench of ozone and blood, a grim testament to the battle that had raged through the night. At his feet lay the shattered remains of a frost giant, a chilling reminder of the cost of victory. *He had sworn to protect Midgard, a duty etched into his very being, but the faces of the fallen haunted his every step.* His father, Odin, would expect a report of the victory; instead, Thor knew he must plead for another way.\"\n\nChapter 2:\n\nHis brother was Loki and he was very crual outside but inside he was good\n\n\n",
